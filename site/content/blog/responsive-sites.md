Title: Responsive sites

Probably this [mother fucking web site](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) sums
it all up. With colorful vocabulary and down to earth arguments, it makes a
good point. What my experience showed me is that designers are so rarely
starting with "function first, looks second". When I say "function" I mean make
it user friendly. I think the fancy term for it is "user experience". Once I
stumbled upon a page explaining what user experience really is. Unfortunately,
I can not find the link to it now. One of the examples was "don't ask for a
type of credit card". When you read about it, Visa cards start with digit 4,
MasterCard start with 51 or 53. There were tons of suggestions like that, but
basically every site should ask for as less interaction with the user as
possible.

To conclude with the quote from the mother fucking web site: "Good design is as
little design as possible". Think about it!

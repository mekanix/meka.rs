I'm trying to keep my private life private, but this is just too weird and works
too good to hide. For few years I'm living with my girlfriend and things are
sometimes good, sometimes bad, as in any relationship (love or otherwise). To be
honest, I got sick of bad times, because in most cases the reason for the
situation to become bad is ridiculous: "you forgot to...", "you didn't..." and
so on.

It's not that I never lived with someone, it's just that I'm the only child of
the only child, so you might think of how much work I didn't do. I don't know
how is it to live with someone, but I do know something else: Scrum! You might
find it weird, but it works. My girlfriend and I are having daily scrum
meetings, sync calendars and plan the day. My idea was, if I know how to lead
the project, and don't know how to have a life with someone, then pretend it's a
project. It can't be worse than this. :o)

Few days ago I wrote about
[pfsense vs openbsd](/2015/06/07/pfsense-vs-openbsd) and
[twitted about it](https://twitter.com/meka_floss/status/607327909431361536). As
you can see, it triggered a flamewar, which was never my intention. The reason I
continued that flamewar (and one more with the same person on other thread) was
the I had nothing better to do, to be honest. I was away from home with my
laptop, and I was tired of programming and administration projects. I've noticed
that OpenBSD community hardly said anything. I don't understand why anyone would
be intimidated with the fact that one person twitted about not using some piece
of software. Having that attitude could never attract people. Linux user group
I'm member of had few men like that, and we ended up pushing away people who
wanted to be part of our group and contribute. Even if people are wrong, they
should be let to make mistake, if they decided to try something out.

On the other hand, the arguments presented were funny. For example, one of the
arguments was that PF on FreeBSD 11 is faster than the one on OpenBSD 5.6. While
this may or may not be true, the fact is that FreeBSD 11 is not released, making
it bleeding edge version. At the same time, OpenBSD 5.7 is the current stable
version, not 5.6. And who said that the speed of firewall was even important,
compared to ease of use and integration with the rest of the system. As a matter
of fact, firewall is just one small part of the system, and it's not even the
reason why I made the switch.

All in all, pfSense community, or at least two gentlemen that were the loudest,
are one more reason why I will not use their product. It's not my anger or any
other emotion. If I learned anything from open source projects is that community
is everything. Sad for pfSense!

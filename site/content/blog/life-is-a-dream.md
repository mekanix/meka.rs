Ever heard of it? Life is a dream? Did you ever think about it? I did. A lot!
And I can tell you it is. Just look at what we do, create, transform and
whatnot. Just by wishing something it comes true. Just by work you get results.
When you think about it, you could do everything differently in your life. You
could shape yourself, your life, your surrounding. Any of us could. I mean,
even quantum physics says that anything is possible. What do we do with that?
Dress up and go to boring work. Are we insane? Are we media oriented? Are we
blind? In a word, fuck you, life. I publicly express my regret for existing in
this world. I regret I'm incompetent to change the world (not really, but it
involves starting from scratch). I'm sorry, but the mediocrity of the world got
to me. Where do I sign up for a [mission to Mars](http://www.mars-one.com) or
exploration of black holes?

  Domain Controllers. This ensured that all network communications and services
  were running efficiently, securely, and with minimal downtime.

- Linux-based System Administration: Led the administration of Linux systems
  that served as the foundation for the company's network infrastructure.
  Ensured proper configuration, updates, and security patches were applied in a
  timely manner to keep systems secure and functional.

- Firewall Configuration & Security: Managed network security using IPTables
  to set up firewalls, securing the company’s internal and external
  communications. I configured firewall rules to prevent unauthorized access,
  protect against external threats, and enforce strict access control policies.

- Email System Setup & Maintenance: Configured and maintained the company's
  email servers, ensuring reliable communication both internally and externally.
  I configured Postfix for mail sending, Dovecot for IMAP, and applied
  necessary filters to ensure security, such as anti-spam measures.

- DNS Setup & Maintenance: Managed the company’s DNS servers using Bind,
  ensuring that the domain names were properly configured and that DNS queries
  were resolved quickly and accurately. This was crucial to maintaining
  seamless internet connectivity and access to company resources.

- User Account & Permission Management: Configured user accounts and
  permissions, ensuring that employees had the appropriate access to the
  network resources they needed while maintaining a secure environment. This
  included managing access to network shares, email services, and domain
  resources.

- System Monitoring & Troubleshooting: Monitored system health and performance,
  ensuring that all services were up and running. Addressed any issues related
  to system performance or network downtime and applied solutions in a timely
  manner to minimize disruptions.

- Documentation & Knowledge Transfer: Created comprehensive documentation
  outlining system configurations, network setups, and maintenance processes to
  ensure that procedures were clear and easily replicable in the event of
  system changes or staff turnover.

Technologies Used: Linux, Postfix, Dovecot, DHCP, DNS (Bind), Samba, IPTables

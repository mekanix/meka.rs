Do you remember when any operating system just worked? Me neither, and I hate
it. I mean, Windows was always just a joke. Just think about it, Microsoft said
their git repository is 300GB in size. How do you compile, let alone read? One
will probably think of Linux, but what about systemd and Richard Stallman?
Honestly, I'm not sure what is more revolting: shitty system software, or the
most annoying guy ever. One might think about BSDs, but what about the support?
FreeBSD being most popular and getting most attraction still lacks support for
a lot of hardware. And the hardware? I don't remember when I bought a piece of
hardware that didn't totally suck. As a matter of fact, how do you even do
proper programming when the underlaying hardware is fucked up? And where are we
as IT going? We're creating bunch of sites and software for what? I can't
remember how many times I've heard "we're creating something revolutionary".
It's like nobody can create just a regular software solving small problems.
Why? I hate the current state, and the worst is the hardware industry. Just
look at the spectra and meltdown. I'm ashamed and sorry for contributing to
this whole circus, where it's only important to sell, get revenue and bail out.
I may never stop doing IT stuff, but I do hate it from the bottom of my soul.
Also, recent years showed me that my colleagues are mostly not interested in the
IT at all, but to get their salary and go home. I can't blame them, but I can't
like them either. As a matter of fact, there are more and more programmers that
have no education. I don't mean formal, as I know some exceptional developers
without a single day at the university, but wish to know more is rare. Like
we're playing this dumb game to put money into someone's pocket, and that
pocket ain't ours. It's like we're doing everything we can to screw this
industry that once was so beautiful. That's why IT feels like a constant
failure, because it is!

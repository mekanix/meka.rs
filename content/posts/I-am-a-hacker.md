What is a hacker? Who the hell knows? On top of that, I'm clamming I'm one of
them. What gives me the right? I'm not sure, but in short, I know one thing:
hackers are smart and they never give up. Once I heard the smartest man I've
ever met saying to a developer: "OK, make something, then Meka will do the
magic". That's the best compliment I've ever got. I guess that makes me smart,
too. And never giving up ... I know I'm that kind of guy. If anyone wants me to
do anything I'm remotely interested in, it's enough I hear "that it's
impossible". I guess it's enough proof I'm persistent.

Let's go from the start. I knew I'm good at math since 3rd grade elementary
school. I've been the best physics student in elementary, too. I've never been
the best student, that's for sure. I was more interested in asking "why" and
"how" than having a good grade. I always asked myself "what if we do this
differently" and it always gave me bad grades, but somehow, when things go
south, I get to answer the tough questions. High school was even worse. I was a
bit above the average. University? Totally below average. Of course, if grades
mean anything to you. The mean shit to me. And let me take this opportunity to
say that except 3 professors, all of them are total crap. One of the proofs is
that I've got this answer to "Why am I failing programming?": "Your algorithms
are too advanced for professors to get them". Let me repeat: I was below
average.

Today, I'm co-founder of a [Tilda Center](http://tilda.center/), Novi Sad's
hackerspace. So, I'm discussing funding and finances with my friend and he told
me "Don't make the same mistake I made with [LUGoNS](https://lugons.org/)". What
he told me is "don't invest too much of your own money into it". How can I not
to? I believe in Tilda with my whole heart. So, after a while, I'm telling him
something like "Well, yeah, I know what you mean, but I can make it work, trust
me. Besides, I know math, physics, electronics, backend and frontend
programming, system and network administration, devops, guitar playing, singing,
audio and video production and post production, cooking and I'm starting with
capoeira trainings this Tuesday. With all this knowledge, I will make it work
on Mars, if needed". I'm not good at all those things equaly, obviously, but
I'm refusing to accept I'm not above average at any of those except capoeira.

For the end, let me just tell you I'm not trying to brag around how good I am at
anything. This post is to remind me I'm not as stupid as I have tendency to tell
people I am, and to remind me of the most important achievement in my life: I
AM A HACKER!!! I have to repeat that in order to understand why I'm so
different and unaccepted. Thank you for reading!

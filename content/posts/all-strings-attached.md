First of all, I'm no physicist. Everything written here is what I've gathered
from other sources, like books and Wikipedia. As I never had a chance to check
my thoughts with someone with proper and formal physics education, I might be
(terribly) wrong, so don't quote me as a scientist or a proven theorist.

Most of my thoughts come from Brian Greene's
[Fabric of the Cosmos](http://www.briangreene.org/?page_id=24). I like how
the book is easy to understand so much that I recommend it to everyone. I'll
admit it, I was hardly waiting to get to the strings. Don't get me wrong, the
whole book is golden, but I was mostly interested in strings. Just imagine
(if you can, but up to now, nobody was able to) that vibrating string manifests
itself as a particle. I mean, different vibrational patterns make up different
things in our Universe: particles, time, energy, radiation, ...  Once more,
strings create time. Wow! What a concept. But I want to talk about something
more scientific, if I may call it that. Throughout the research which is mostly
mathematical, scientists came to conclude that the string theory gave birth to
5 different frameworks of string theory. It's like you say there are 5 different
variations of the same theory. A bit awkward situation for science, but the 6th
variation solved it all, or at least is trying to do that. It's not the 6th
variation, it's "one ring to rule them all", to be a bit more precise. It's
called the M-theory and nobody knows what M stands for. The craziest proposal
I've heard of what M is: 180 degrees of W which stands for Witten, the person
who came up with the idea of M-theory.
[Edward Witten](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Witten) is such a crazy guy
that you have to love him. Although he's physicist, he's the first man who got
the Fields Medal award, which is award in math. Unbelievable guy!

Anyway, back to the topic. In short, there are strings which are loops, and
strings which are like a rope with two ends. Researchers found that "rope like"
strings are attached to 2 dimensional branes. I won't go into what branes are
for two reasons: I don't know and it's not that important at this time. The
funny thing is that all forces are rope alike, except gravity. Even more, all
forces except gravity are strings with two ends on the same brane. Now, this is
astonishing, at least to me. This makes gravity special, which researchers knew
before string theory, but it's even more special now. In theory, strings are
1-dimensional objects living in a 11-dimensional environment (10 spacial and 1
time dimension). All vibrational patterns of all known forces and matter are
bound to the same brane, except gravity. This makes gravity able to traverse our
3 spacial dimensions and span on other branes. How? Gravity is made of loop
strings, hence not being tied to any brane. Isn't that remarkable? I'm thrilled
that we can (at least in theory) communicate with other dimensions through
gravity. How? First thought is
[gravitational wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave). Imagine
that you can use gravitational waves to create bits, just like computers use
electromagnetic field. I don't even know if it's theoretically possible, but
dreaming about other dimensions is becoming less of a dream and more of a
research. That makes me happy!

As my plans for summer festivals and beaches are ruined, my activity in
[Tilda Center](http://tilda.center) increased. Pure action-reaction physics at
work. :o) We got two new tables and weekly meetings on Mondays and Thursdays.
On Mondays is a general discussion or gathering to just hang out. On Thursdays,
theme of the meeting is [One Love](https://github.com/one-love), project a few
of us are contributing to. In future, we're hoping to fund our hackerspace with
it. I can tell you it's interesting. Amount of ideas worth trying out is
astonishing. One of the members even brought guitar for slight adjustments.
Knowledge is flowing, and it's great. We even have time for Danube beach, when
the weather is kind enough. :o) Soon, I hope we'll have "conference" room in
Tilda ready. We already have a white board on the wall. Ah, I love drawings on
the meetings. So much easier to comprehend someone else's idea if it's drawn. I
tend to teach our young members that everything can be represented as a
drawing, and if it can't, you can make analogy to something from common life.
It's great how much errors are stressed out like this, during planing stage.
Reminds me of [Brad Victor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII). We
opened back in April and we caused so much joy, but there is so much to explore
and so much to learn. What a great ride up to now!

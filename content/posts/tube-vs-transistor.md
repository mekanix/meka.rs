For so long I've listened about debate how tubes have "warmer" sound. All
audiophiles will tell you that you can not compare amps which are tube based to
those that have transistors in them. I don't say they're wrong, but I'm never
satisfied with "It's just the way it is" explanation, so I searched for more
info. First, I don't believe that just because you use tubes you get better
sound. There has to be more to it. As they've explained me, tubes have a feature
which makes even harmonics stand out, while the transistor does the same for odd
ones. This makes tube harmonics get along better. For simplicity, think of
overtones which are octaves. Octaves are 2x, 4x, 8x ... the original sound which
are even harmonics.

Now the fun part. I didn't know, but more than once I've heard from really
educated people that you can make an amp with transistors which makes even
harmonics stand out. You'll probably ask yourself, just like I did, why don't
we have these amps around. I don't know, but I'm almost sure it has something
to do with economy.

There is some area of audio amps where tubes are superb and transistors can't
ever come close to them: distortion in guitar amps. The reason for this is that
tubes and transistors act totally different when they are saturated, hence the
difference in sound of distortion.

I'm a guitar player, among other things, and the best think I can think of, in
theory, is tube preamp with transistor power amp which makes even harmonics
stand out. I don't know if it's possible, but I would sure would like to try to
create one.

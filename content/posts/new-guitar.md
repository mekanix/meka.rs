After 3 years in the making, I finally got my new guitar. I got [Seymour Duncan
Blackouts Metal](https://www.seymourduncan.com/single-product/blackouts-metal)
for it. That pickup is insanely hot and until my new guitar was done, I used it
in my Les Paul, so pickup is the same in both guitars. Here is a riff from our
upcoming single with Neural Amp Modeler and Impulse Response instead of guitar
amplifier, cabinet and microphone.

## My impressions

I love Les Paul Custom for so long and I considered it the best guitar in the
world. Together with EMG 81/85, it is insane. I can't believe that I'm saying
this, but there is something better than Les Paul, and it's my new guitar. It is
made by a long time friend of mine and solo guitarist in my band, so he knows
what picking style I use, what bands I like, what amps I'm after. With somebody
knowing me so well, he couldn't but make a guitar better than Gibson. I love how
it bites more than Les Paul. It will definitely be my sound on our upcoming
single and album.

Just in case you're wondering how it looks, it is black ESP Viper with "LUST"
(the first word of the name of my band) instead of inlays.

I think it's about 15 years now that I want a hackerspace in my town, and today
that dream become reality. The hackerspace or makerspace (I never could tell
the difference) is and will be alternate place for acquiring knowledge.
Let's go to the beginnings and see how it all unfolded.

Inspiration
===========

I started dreaming about hackerspace more seriously about 2 years ago. What was
the real trigger is the last year's [BalCCon](https://2k14.balccon.org). One of
our guests was Mitch Altman. If you never heard of the guy, I recommend his [TED
talk in Brussels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkiX7R1-kaY). The man is one
of those smiley faces that radiates out "it's easy if you really want it"
message. One night we were sitting in the basement of the museum where the
BalCCon was held and talked about starting a hackerspace in Novi Sad. He had a
lot to say, but only one thing he said stuck in my head: "Out of 60k
hackerspaces round the globe, not single one ever failed because of lack of
funding". It took me two weeks to process that. To be more precise, I live in a
place and time where people are happy if they have any job. Let me repeat that,
it's important: "ANY JOB". That's the reason I couldn't just accept the truth
about hackerspace funding. Once I accepted that in my mind, I was ready for the
the next step.

You might think that the next step would be opening the hackerspace, but no. I
had to talk to a lot more people (on BalCCon, of course) who had experience with
this matter. I've heard all kinds of squat stories, funding initiatives,
creative ways of persuading landlords how to keep the rent low, and such, but
one man was really standing out: Arnd from
[Technologia Incognita](http://techinc.nl/) (sorry, Arnd, I don't know your
online identity). Although Mitch is inspiring, Arnd gave me tons of stories from
his hackerspace experience that really pushed me forward. With all of these
educational stories, I've set my path.

DIY
===

As always, we tried asking for resources from other organizations and
foundations with no luck. At one point I was pissed of by my incompetence to
start a hackerspace. All other people are able to do it, but not me. I took it
really personal, so I sit down and realized one simple fact: I have my own flat,
but if I didn't have it, I would be forced to rent one, like most of my friends
do, and it's the same with the hackerspace. So I decided to change the client,
and the minimal salary I would be satisfied with, and I made it. Don't get me
wrong, there are friends of mine that give moral and financial support, I was
just sick of planing projects to fund a hackerspace (in short, begging), and I
was determined to be able to fund it on my own, if everything else fails.

Result
======

In short, the result is [Tilda Center](http://tilda.center). I'm sitting in the
hackerspace of my town while writing this post with Internet connection provided
by the kind people of NS Wireless. We have our own 67 square meters of space to
gather, hack, talk, exchange knowledge and welcome new people. Come, visit us!

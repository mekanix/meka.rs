For years I have [M-Audio Delta 
1010LT](http://www.m-audio.com/products/view/delta-1010lt#.VIS-oN_0_RY). It's 
great, but it lacks some things I need now. One of the things is being 
worldclock master. Second is Hi-Z input. All of that is covered with [Presonus 
Audiobox 1818VLS](http://www.presonus.com/products/AudioBox-1818VSL). As a 
consequence, I can use my [Line 6 POD X3 Pro](http://line6.com/legacy/podx3pro) 
without switching who's the master on a card (it kills all audio programs, too) 
and without ever changing the routing or setup. What it basically means is that 
POD can run in stereo mode in which it expects two guitars on the inputs, and 
each guitar has only one channel (left or right). The reason I want this is so 
I can route from [Ardour's](https://ardour.org/) outputs of clean guitars to 
POD when doing playback, and route one Audiobox's input to two inputs of POD, 
emulating two guitars. Why am I telling you this? I've ordered Presonus, and I 
can't wait to hear how it works with my Ubuntu. It's almost Christmas :o) Once 
it's in my posession, I'll tell you all about routing audio signals via 
[JACK](http://jackaudio.org/).

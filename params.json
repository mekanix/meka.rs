{"name":"Meka.rs","tagline":"My site","body":"# Jekyll Now\r\n\r\n**Jekyll** is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll))\r\n\r\n**Jekyll Now** makes it easier to create your Jekyll blog, by eliminating a lot of the up front setup.\r\n\r\n- You don't need to touch the command line\r\n- You don't need to install/configure ruby, rvm/rbenv, ruby gems :relaxed:\r\n- You don't need to install runtime dependancies like markdown processors, Pygments, etc\r\n- If you're on Windows, this will make setting up Jekyll a lot easier\r\n- It's easy to try out, you can just delete your forked repository if you don't like it\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes you'll be set up with a minimal, responsive blog like the one below giving you more time to spend on writing epic blog posts!\r\n\r\n![Jekyll Now Theme Screenshot](/images/jekyll-now-theme-screenshot.jpg \"Jekyll Now Theme Screenshot\")\r\n\r\n## Quick Start\r\n\r\n### Step 1) Fork Jekyll Now to your User Repository\r\n\r\nFork this repo, then rename the repository to yourgithubusername.github.io.\r\n\r\nYour Jekyll blog will often be viewable immediately at <http://yourgithubusername.github.io> (if it's not, you can force it to build by completing step 2)\r\n\r\n![Step 1](/images/step1.gif \"Step 1\")\r\n\r\n### Step 2) Customize and view your site\r\n\r\nEnter your site name, description, avatar and many other options by editing the _config.yml file. You can easily turn on Google Analytics tracking, Disqus commenting and social icons here too.\r\n\r\nMaking a change to _config.yml (or any file in your repository) will force GitHub Pages to rebuild your site with jekyll. Your rebuilt site will be viewable a few seconds later at <http://yourgithubusername.github.io>\r\n\r\n> There are 3 different ways that you can make changes to your blog's files:\r\n\r\n> 1. Edit files within your new username.github.io repository in the browser at GitHub.com (shown below).\r\n> 2. Use a third party GitHub content editor, like [Prose by Development Seed](http://prose.io). It's optimized for use with Jekyll making markdown editing, writing drafts, and uploading images really easy.\r\n> 3. Clone down your repository and make updates locally, then push them to your GitHub repository.\r\n\r\n![_config.yml](/images/config.png \"_config.yml\")\r\n  \r\n### Step 3) Publish your first blog post\r\n\r\nEdit `/_posts/2014-3-3-Hello-World.md` to publish your first blog post. This [Markdown Cheatsheet](http://www.jekyllnow.com/Markdown-Style-Guide/) might come in handy.\r\n\r\n![First Post](/images/first-post.png \"First Post\")\r\n\r\n> You can add additional posts in the browser on GitHub.com too! Just hit the + icon in `/_posts/` to create new content. Just make sure to include the [front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) block at the top of each new blog post and make sure the post's filename is in this format: year-month-day-title.md\r\n\r\n## Local Development\r\n\r\n1. Clone down your fork `git clone git@github.com:yourusername/yourusername.github.io.git`\r\n2. Install Jekyll `gem install jekyll`\r\n3. Install plug-ins that we use `gem install jemoji jekyll-sitemap`\r\n4. Serve the site and watch for markup/sass changes `jekyll serve --watch`\r\n5. View your website at http://0.0.0.0:4000\r\n6. Commit any changes and push everything to the master branch of your GitHub user repository. GitHub Pages will then rebuild and serve your website.\r\n\r\n## Moar!\r\n\r\nI've created a more detailed walkthrough, [**Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages**](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) over at the Smashing Magazine website.
